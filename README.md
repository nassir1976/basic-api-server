## Requirements
Build a REST API using Express, by creating a proper series of endpoints that perform CRUD operations on a database, using the REST standard

## Data Models
- Create 2 in-memory data models using ES6 Classes, exported as Node Modules
- Define your field names and an empty data storage in the constructor
- The classes should have the following methods defined, to perform CRUD Operations:
create()
- Should ensure that the record created only has the fields that you defined
- get() 
- read()
- update()
- delete()



## Routes
- In your express server, create a route module for each data model that youâ€™ve created. Within the router module, create REST route handlers for each of the REST Methods that properly calls the correct CRUD method from the matching data model.



### Add a Record
- CRUD Operation: Create
- REST Method: POST
- Path: /food
- path: /clothes

- Input: JSON Object in the Request Body
- Returns: The record that was added to the database.
- must generate an ID and attach it to the object
- hould verify that only the fields you define get saved as a record


- CRUD Operation: Read
- REST Method: GET
- Path: /food
- Returns: An array of objects, each object being one entry from your database

Get One Record

- CRUD Operation: Read
- REST Method: GET
- Path: /food/1
- Returns: The object from the database, which has the id matching that which is in the path
### Update A Record
- CRUD Operation: Update
- REST Method: PUT
- Path: /food/1
- Input: JSON Object in the Request Body
- Returns: The object from the database, which has the id matching that which is in the path, with the updated/changed data
- You should verify that only the fields you define get saved as a record

### Delete A Record
- CRUD Operation: Destroy
- REST Method: DELETE
- Path: /food/1
- Returns: The record from the database as it exists after you delete it (i.e. null)

### Documentation
- Compose a UML or Process/Data Flow Diagram for every application
